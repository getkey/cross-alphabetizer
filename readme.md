# Cross-alphabetizer

This software modifies fonts in [SFD format](https://fontforge.org/docs/techref/sfdformat.html) with a transcription table. This allows using the font to display text in another script than its native script.

For example, before a trip to Greece, I am setting my devices to this font, to read French with the Greek alphabet instead of the Latin alphabet. This should get me more familiar to the Greek alphabet so I can easily decipher it.
